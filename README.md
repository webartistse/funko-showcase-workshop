### What are we building?

The app we are building is to showcase/inventory any type of collection or memorabillia you own. For this workshop we are going to focus around Funko Pops. We all love those right? The app will display a card component using MaterialUI that has a picture, the medium, character name, year released, and number in line.

You will also have the ability to add a funko or edit one.

There is also search funtionality that you will be build in order to quickly find the item you are looking for.
